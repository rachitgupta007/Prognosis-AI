        <h1>The Nervous System: NVLink, Infiniband & Ultra Ethernet</h1>
        <p class="byline">PART 6: THE COMPUTER IS THE NETWORK</p>

        <p>Stop looking at the chip. In the era of the 100,000-GPU cluster, the chip is no longer the unit of compute.
            The chip is merely a node. <strong>The actual computer is the network.</strong></p>

        <p>We are attempting to trick 72 distinct chips in a rack into "hallucinating" that they are a single brain. We
            are fighting the speed of light, the resistance of copper, and the entropy of packet collisions. If the
            network jitters by a microsecond, the entire cluster stalls.</p>

        <div class="viz-container">
            <canvas id="viz-networking"></canvas>
            <div class="caption">Fig 6. Packet Spraying: Ultra Ethernet vs Traditional ECMP</div>
        </div>

        <h3>Scale-Up: The Copper Sarcophagus</h3>
        <p>Inside the rack, we use <strong>NVLink</strong>. This is "Scale-Up." The goal is to make 72 GPUs share memory
            as if they were one. The bandwidth is insane: <strong>1.8 TB/s per GPU</strong> (28x faster than PCIe Gen
            5).</p>

        <p>To achieve this, NVIDIA builds a "Copper Sarcophagus"—a dense wall of cabling. Why copper? Because converting
            electricity to light (optics) takes energy (~15pJ/bit). By keeping the chips close (inches apart), we can
            drive the signal electrically. But we are hitting the <strong>Skin Effect</strong> limit. You can't run 224G
            copper traces further than a meter.</p>

        <h3>Scale-Out: The Rebellion of the Ethernet</h3>
        <p>Once you leave the rack, you need optics. This is "Scale-Out." For years, InfiniBand was the only choice. But
            now, the <strong>Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC)</strong> is fighting back.</p>

        <p>The problem with standard Ethernet is that it is "lossy." If a packet drops, YouTube buffers. If a packet
            drops in AI training, the entire supercomputer waits. The UEC fix is <strong>Packet Spraying</strong>.
            Instead of sending a flow down one wire (where it might get stuck), the NIC chops the message into
            "flowlets" and sprays them across <em>all</em> available paths. It guarantees load balancing and prevents
            tail latency.</p>

        <h3>The Wildcard: Silicon Photonics</h3>
        <p>We are running out of "Beachfront" on the chip edge. We can't fit enough copper pins. The future is
            <strong>Co-Packaged Optics (CPO)</strong>—moving the laser directly onto the chip. If the GPU speaks
            "light," the distinction between Scale-Up and Scale-Out dissolves. The Data Center becomes the computer.</p>
