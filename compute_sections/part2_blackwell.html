        <h1>The Monolith: Breaking the Reticle Limit</h1>
        <p class="byline">PART 2: THE PHYSICS OF PACKAGING</p>

        <p>There is a specific feeling you get when you look at a die shot of the <strong>NVIDIA Blackwell
                B200</strong>. It doesn’t look like a computer chip. It looks like a map of a dense, sprawling
            metropolis that has run out of land and decided to build <em>bridges</em>.</p>

        <p>If you zoom in, you see a seam. A vertical scar running down the center of the silicon. That scar is the most
            important feature of the chip. It represents the moment where humanity officially hit the "God Limit" of
            semiconductor manufacturing—the <strong>Reticle Limit</strong>—and decided to cheat.</p>

        <h3>The 858mm² Prison Cell</h3>
        <p>To understand why Blackwell is a "stitched" chip, you have to understand the printer. And by printer, I mean
            the <strong>ASML TWINSCAN NXE:3800E</strong>. This machine projects Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) light through
            a mask (the reticle) onto the silicon wafer. But the projection lens has a maximum physical field of view:
            <strong>26mm x 33mm</strong>.</p>

        <p>This gives us a maximum printable area of roughly <strong>858 mm²</strong>. This is the Reticle Limit. You
            physically cannot print a chip bigger than this. The lens won't allow it. The optics will distort.</p>

        <p>NVIDIA's previous generation, the H100, was <strong>814 mm²</strong>. They were already touching the walls.
            For Blackwell, they needed 208 billion transistors. They needed ~1600 mm². The physics said "No." So NVIDIA
            said, "We will print two, and we will glue them together."</p>

            <canvas id="viz-blackwell"></canvas>
            <div class="caption">Fig 2. Exploded View: The CoWoS-L Stack & The 10TB/s Stitch</div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Glue: CoWoS-L & The Interposer Crisis</h3>
        <p>Connecting these massive dies requires advanced packaging. In the past, we used <strong>CoWoS-S</strong>
            (Silicon Interposer), where the chips sat on a massive slab of passive silicon. But a silicon slab large
            enough for two Blackwell dies would be huge, brittle, and impossibly expensive. It would crack under the
            thermal stress of manufacturing.</p>

        <p>So TSMC invented <strong>CoWoS-L</strong> (Local Silicon Interconnect). Instead of a giant silicon slab, they
            use a reconstituted organic substrate (like a high-end PCB) for structural integrity. But organic material
            is "dirty"—you can't print microscopic wires on it. So, they embed tiny <strong>Silicon Bridges
                (LSI)</strong> inside the substrate, right where the two dies touch.</p>

        <p>Think of it like two islands connected not by a ferry, but by a hyperloop tunnel welded directly into the
            bedrock. This bridge carries the <strong>NV-HBI (High Bandwidth Interface)</strong>.</p>

        <h3>The 10 TB/s Illusion</h3>
        <p>The bandwidth across this stitch is <strong>10 Terabytes per second</strong>. To put this in perspective:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PCIe Gen 6:</strong> ~0.25 TB/s</li>
            <li><strong>H100 Memory Bandwidth:</strong> 3.3 TB/s</li>
            <li><strong>NV-HBI Stitch:</strong> 10.0 TB/s</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The connection <em>between the two halves of the chip</em> is 3x faster than the memory of the previous
            generation's supercomputer. This speed is critical for <strong>Cache Coherency</strong>. It allows the
            software to treat the two dies as a single logical unit. The programmer doesn't need to know it's a
            Frankenstein chip. They just see one massive pool of logic.</p>

        <h3>The Yield Economics</h3>
        <p>Why go through this pain? Because of the Yield Curve. Semiconductor yield follows an exponential decay based
            on area ($A$) and defect density ($D_0$):</p>

        <p>$$ Y = e^{-D_0 \cdot A} $$</p>

        <p>If you tried to print a monolithic 1600 mm² chip, your yield would be near zero. A single speck of dust would
            kill the entire superchip. By printing two 800 mm² chips, you stay on the safe side of the curve, bin them,
            and then stitch the good ones. It is the only economic way to build big silicon.</p>
