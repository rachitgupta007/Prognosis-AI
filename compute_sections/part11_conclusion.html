        <h1>Conclusion: The Glass Floor</h1>
        <p class="byline">PART 11: THE UNIT OF PROGRESS IS THE JOULE</p>

        <p>We have traveled from the nanometer scale of an ASML mirror to the planetary scale of a Google datacenter. We
            have seen how the physics of light, the resistance of copper, and the economics of yield curve define the
            future of AI.</p>

        <p>We are not building software anymore. We are building a machine that spans from the atom to the ocean. It is
            a machine that turns electricity into intelligence. And the only thing stopping us is the <strong>Glass
                Floor</strong>—the fundamental limits of thermodynamics and the speed of light.</p>

        <p>But as we have seen with Blackwell, with the Optical Mesh, and with o1, we are finding ways to cheat. We are
            bending the curve. The scream of the fans is getting louder, but the intelligence is getting brighter.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the Compute Century.</p>
